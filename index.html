      <p> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Duc Le â€” thank you for visiting my personal portfolio. I sincerely welcome you and hope this space provides a comprehensive insight into my technical journey, experience, and future aspirations.</p>
      <p>Born in 1996 and having immigrated to the United States in 2010, I am a proud Vietnamese American with over a decade of experience in the technology industry. I am a personal initiative where I deliver innovative, practical, and impactful technology solutions tailored to diverse client needs. </p>
      <p>As a well-rounded professional with a foundation in Computer Science and Information Technology, I bring an integrated approach to solving complex problems. I hold an Associateâ€™s degree in Computer Science along with multiple certifications in IT infrastructure, 
         software development, and web technologies. My passion for technology began with a fascination for computer systems and evolved into a multifaceted career blending technical expertise with real-world impact.</p>
      <p>In the IT and support field, I specialize in designing, configuring, and maintaining secure and high-performance systems â€” including network infrastructure, endpoint security, and cloud-based services. I ensure systems are both robust and scalable to meet organizational goals.</p>
      <p>As a web developer, I create dynamic, responsive, and accessible websites and applications using modern technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React. My focus is always on blending user experience with functionality to develop interfaces that are both beautiful and efficient.</p>
      <p>Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at San Diego State University, with plans to continue my academic journey toward a Masterâ€™s degree at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). My current areas of interest include full-stack development, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and data-driven applications. I actively engage in personal and academic projects that help expand and sharpen my skills.</p>
      <p>I am always open to collaboration, mentorship, and innovation. Please feel free to connect with me regarding professional opportunities, project ideas, or simply to talk tech. Thank you again for taking the time to explore my page â€” your interest and support mean a great deal.</p>

    <p>Best regards,</p>
   <p>Duc Le</p>
